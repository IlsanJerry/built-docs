There are
the Elasticsearch nodes that form the cluster and often Logstash instances,
Kibana instances, Beats agents, and clients all communicating with the cluster.
It should not come as a surprise that securing such clusters has many facets and
layers.</p><p>The Elastic Stack security features provide the means to secure the Elastic cluster
on several levels:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="setting-up-authentication.html" title="User authentication">User authentication</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="authorization.html" title="User authorization">User authorization and access control</a></li><li class="listitem">Node/client authentication and channel encryption</li><li class="listitem">Auditing</li></ul></div><h3><a id="_nodeclient_authentication_and_channel_encryption"></a>Node/client authentication and channel encryption<a href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.2/docs/en/stack/security/how-security-works.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>The security features support configuring SSL/TLS for securing the
communication channels to, from and within the cluster. This support accounts for:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Encryption of data transmitted over the wires</li><li class="listitem">Certificate based node authentication - preventing unauthorized nodes/clients
from establishing a connection with the cluster.</li></ul></div><p>For more information, see <a class="link" href="encrypting-communications.html" title="Encrypting communications">Encrypting Communications</a>.</p><p>The security features also enable you to <a class="link" href="ip-filtering.html" title="Restricting connections with IP filtering">configure IP Filters</a>
which can be seen as a light mechanism for node/client authentication. With IP
filtering, you can restrict the nodes and clients that can connect to the
cluster based on their IP addresses. The IP filters configuration provides
whitelisting and blacklisting of IPs, subnets and DNS domains.</p><h3><a id="_auditing"></a>Auditing<a href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.2/docs/en/stack/security/how-security-works.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>When dealing with any secure system, it is critical to have a audit trail
mechanism set in place. Audit trails log various activities/events that occur in
the system, enabling you to analyze and back track past events when things go
wrong (e.g. security breach).</p><p>The security features provide such audit trail functionality for all nodes in
the cluster. You can configure the audit level which accounts for the type of
events that are logged. These events include failed authentication attempts,
user access denied, node connection denied, and more.</p><p>For more information on auditing see <a class="xref" href="auditing.html" title="Auditing security events"><em>Auditing security events</em></a>.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><span class="prev"><a href="elasticsearch-security.html">
