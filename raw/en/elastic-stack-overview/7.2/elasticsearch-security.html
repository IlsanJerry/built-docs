You can
password-protect your data as well as implement more advanced security
measures such as encrypting communications, role-based access control,
IP filtering, and auditing. This guide describes how to configure the security
features you need, and interact with your secured cluster.</p><p>Security protects Elasticsearch clusters by:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="elasticsearch-security.html#preventing-unauthorized-access" title="Preventing unauthorized access">Preventing unauthorized access</a>

way to <span class="emphasis"><em>authenticate</em></span> users. This simply means that you need a way to validate
that a user is who they claim to be. For example, you have to make sure only
the person named <span class="emphasis"><em>Kelsey Andorra</em></span> can sign in as the user <code class="literal">kandorra</code>. The
Elasticsearch security features provide a standalone authentication mechanism that enables
you to quickly password-protect your cluster. If you’re already using
<a class="link" href="ldap-realm.html" title="LDAP user authentication">LDAP</a>, <a class="link" href="active-directory-realm.html" title="Active Directory user authentication">Active Directory</a>, or
<a class="link" href="pki-realm.html" title="PKI user authentication">PKI</a> to manage users in your organization, the security features
are able to integrate with those systems to perform user authentication.</p><p>In many cases, simply authenticating users isn’t enough. You also need a way to
control what data users have access to and what tasks they can perform. The
Elasticsearch security features enable you to <span class="emphasis"><em>authorize</em></span> users by assigning access
<span class="emphasis"><em>privileges</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>roles</em></span> and assigning those roles to users. For example, this
<a class="link" href="authorization.html" title="User authorization">role-based access control</a> mechanism (a.k.a RBAC) enables
you to specify that the user <code class="literal">kandorra</code> can only perform read operations on the
<code class="literal">events</code> index and can’t do anything at all with other indices.</p><p>The security features also support <a class="link" href="ip-filtering.html" title="Restricting connections with IP filtering">IP-based authorization</a>.
You can whitelist and blacklist specific IP addresses or subnets to control
network-level access to a server.</p><h3><a id="preserving-data-integrity"></a>Preserving data integrity<a href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.2/docs/en/stack/security/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>A critical part of security is keeping confidential data confidential.
Elasticsearch has built-in protections against accidental data loss and
corruption. However, there’s nothing to stop deliberate tampering or data
interception. The Elastic Stack security features preserve the integrity of your
data by <a class="link" href="ssl-tls.html" title="Setting up TLS on a cluster">encrypting communications</a> to and from nodes.</p><h3><a id="maintaining-audit-trail"></a>Maintaining an audit trail<a href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.2/docs/en/stack/security/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>Keeping a system secure takes vigilance. By using Elastic Stack security features to
maintain an audit trail, you can easily see who is accessing your cluster and
what they’re doing. By analyzing access patterns and failed attempts to access
your cluster, you can gain insights into attempted attacks and data breaches.
Keeping an auditable log of the activity in your cluster can also help diagnose
operational issues.</p><h3><a id="_where_to_go_next_2"></a>Where to Go Next<a href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/7.2/docs/en/stack/security/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="security-getting-started.html" title="Tutorial: Getting started with security">Getting Started</a>
