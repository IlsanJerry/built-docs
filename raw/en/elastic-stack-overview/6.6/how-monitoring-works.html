metrics for the stack are stored. By default, they are stored in local indices.</p><div class="tip admon"><div class="icon"><img alt="Tip" src="images/icons/tip.png" /></div><div class="admon_content"><p>In production, we strongly recommend using a separate monitoring
Elasticsearch cluster. Using a separate monitoring cluster
prevents production cluster outages from impacting your ability to access your
monitoring data. It also prevents monitoring activities from impacting the
performance of your production cluster. For the same reason, we also
recommend to use a separate Kibana instance that is connected to the separate
monitoring cluster.</p></div></div><p>The following diagram illustrates a typical monitoring architecture with separate
production and monitoring clusters:</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="monitoring/images/architecture10.png" alt="A typical monitoring environment" /></div></div><p><span class="Admonishment Admonishment--beta">
      [<span class="Admonishment-title u-mono">beta</span>]
      <span class="Admonishment-detail">This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.</span></span>
 In 6.4 and later, you can use Metricbeat to collect and ship data about
Kibana, rather than routing it through Elasticsearch. In 6.5 and later, you can also use
Metricbeat to collect and ship data about Elasticsearch. For example:</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="monitoring/images/architecture20.png" alt="A typical monitoring environment that includes Metricbeat" /></div></div><p>If you have at least a gold license, you can route data from multiple production
clusters to a single monitoring cluster. For more information about the
differences between various subscription levels, see: <a class="ulink" href="https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions" target="_top">https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions</a></p><div class="important admon"><div class="icon"><img alt="Important" src="images/icons/important.png" /></div><div class="admon_content"><p>In general, the monitoring cluster and the clusters being monitored
should be running the same version of the stack. A monitoring cluster cannot
monitor production clusters running newer versions of the stack. If necessary,
the monitoring cluster can monitor production clusters running older versions,
but the versions cannot differ by more than one major version.</p></div></div><p>If you use Kibana to visualize data and administer the cluster, you might want to
create a dedicated Kibana instance for monitoring, rather than using a single
Kibana instance to access both your production cluster and monitoring cluster:</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="monitoring/images/architecture30.png" alt="A separate Kibana instance accesses the monitoring cluster" /></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><span class="prev"><a href="xpack-monitoring.html">
