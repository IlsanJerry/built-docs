called <span class="emphasis"><em>realms</em></span>. A <span class="emphasis"><em>realm</em></span> is used to resolve and authenticate users based on
authentication tokens. X-Pack security provides the following built-in realms:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>native</em></span></span></dt><dd>An internal realm where users are stored in a dedicated Elasticsearch index.
This realm supports an authentication token in the form of username and password,
and is available by default when no realms are explicitly configured. The users
are managed via the <a class="ulink" href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/security-api.html#security-user-apis" target="_top">user management APIs</a>.
See <a class="xref" href="native-realm.html" title="Native user authentication">Native user authentication</a>.</dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>ldap</em></span></span></dt><dd>A realm that uses an external LDAP server to authenticate the
users. This realm supports an authentication token in the form of username and
password, and requires explicit configuration in order to be used. See
<a class="xref" href="ldap-realm.html" title="LDAP user authentication">LDAP user authentication</a>.</dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>active_directory</em></span></span></dt><dd>A realm that uses an external Active Directory Server to authenticate the
users. With this realm, users are authenticated by usernames and passwords.
See <a class="xref" href="active-directory-realm.html" title="Active Directory user authentication">Active Directory user authentication</a>.</dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>pki</em></span></span></dt><dd>A realm that authenticates users using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This
realm works in conjunction with SSL/TLS and identifies the users through the
Distinguished Name (DN) of the client’s X.509 certificates. See <a class="xref" href="pki-realm.html" title="PKI user authentication">PKI user authentication</a>.</dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span></span></dt><dd>An internal realm where users are defined in files stored on each node in the
Elasticsearch cluster. This realm supports an authentication token in the form
of username and password and is always available. See <a class="xref" href="file-realm.html" title="File-based user authentication">File-based user authentication</a>.</dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>saml</em></span></span></dt><dd>A realm that facilitates authentication using the SAML 2.0 Web SSO protocol.
This realm is designed to support authentication through Kibana and is not
intended for use in the REST API.  See <a class="xref" href="saml-realm.html" title="SAML authentication">SAML authentication</a>.</dd></dl></div><p>X-Pack security also supports custom realms. If you need to integrate with another
authentication system, you can build a custom realm plugin. For more information,
see <a class="link" href="custom-realms.html" title="Integrating with other authentication systems">Integrating with Other Authentication Systems</a>.</p><p>Realms live within a <span class="emphasis"><em>realm chain</em></span>. It is essentially a prioritized list of
configured realms (typically of various types). The order of the list determines
the order in which the realms will be consulted. You should make sure each
configured realm has a distinct <code class="literal">order</code> setting. In the event that two or more
realms have the same <code class="literal">order</code>, they will be processed in <code class="literal">name</code> order.
During the authentication process, X-Pack security will consult and try to
authenticate the request one realm at a time.
Once one of the realms successfully authenticates the request, the authentication
is considered to be successful and the authenticated user will be associated
with the request (which will then proceed to the authorization phase). If a realm
cannot authenticate the request, the next in line realm in the chain will be
consulted. If all realms in the chain could not authenticate the request, the
authentication is then considered to be unsuccessful and an authentication error
will be returned (as HTTP status code <code class="literal">401</code>).</p><div class="note admon"><div class="icon"><img alt="Note" src="images/icons/note.png" /></div><div class="admon_content"><p>Some systems (e.g. Active Directory) have a temporary lock-out period after
      several successive failed login attempts. If the same username exists in
      multiple realms, unintentional account lockouts are possible. For more
      information, please see <a class="link" href="trouble-shoot-active-directory.html" title="Users are frequently locked out of Active Directory">here</a>.</p></div></div><p>The default realm chain contains the <code class="literal">native</code> and <code class="literal">file</code> realms. To explicitly,
configure a realm chain, you specify the chain in <code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code>. When you
configure a realm chain, only the realms you specify are used for authentication.
To use the <code class="literal">native</code> and <code class="literal">file</code> realms, you must include them in the chain.</p><p>The following snippet configures a realm chain that includes the <code class="literal">file</code> and
<code class="literal">native</code> realms, as well as two LDAP realms and an Active Directory realm.</p><div class="pre_wrapper lang-yaml"><pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-yaml">xpack.security.authc:

realm type dictates its own set of required and optional settings. That said,
there are
<a class="ulink" href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/security-settings.html#ref-realm-settings" target="_top">settings that are common to all realms</a>.</p><p>Realm types can roughly be classified in two categories:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Internal</span></dt><dd>Realms that are internal to Elasticsearch and don’t require any
communication with external parties. They are fully managed by
X-Pack security. There can only be a maximum of one configured realm
per internal realm type. X-Pack security provides two internal realm
types: <code class="literal">native</code> and <code class="literal">file</code>.</dd><dt><span class="term">External</span></dt><dd>Realms that require interaction with parties/components external to
Elasticsearch, typically, with enterprise grade identity management
systems. Unlike internal realms, there can be as many external realms
as one would like - each with its own unique name and configuration.
X-Pack security provides the following external realm types: <code class="literal">ldap</code>,
<code class="literal">active_directory</code>, <code class="literal">saml</code>, and <code class="literal">pki</code>.</dd></dl></div></div><div class="navfooter"><span class="prev"><a href="internal-users.html">
