With X-Pack security,
you can password-protect your data as well as implement more advanced security
measures such as encrypting communications, role-based access control,
IP filtering, and auditing. This guide describes how to configure the security
features you need, and interact with your secured cluster.</p><p>Security protects Elasticsearch clusters by:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="elasticsearch-security.html#preventing-unauthorized-access" title="Preventing Unauthorized Access">Preventing unauthorized access</a>

way to <span class="emphasis"><em>authenticate</em></span> users. This simply means that you need a way to validate
that a user is who they claim to be. For example, you have to make sure only
the person named <span class="emphasis"><em>Kelsey Andorra</em></span> can sign in as the user <code class="literal">kandorra</code>. X-Pack
Security provides a standalone authentication mechanism that enables you to
quickly password-protect your cluster. If you’re already using <a class="link" href="ldap-realm.html" title="LDAP user authentication">LDAP</a>,
<a class="link" href="active-directory-realm.html" title="Active Directory user authentication">Active Directory</a>, or <a class="link" href="pki-realm.html" title="PKI user authentication">PKI</a> to manage
users in your organization, X-Pack security is able to integrate with those
systems to perform user authentication.</p><p>In many cases, simply authenticating users isn’t enough. You also need a way to
control what data users have access to and what tasks they can perform. X-Pack security
enables you to <span class="emphasis"><em>authorize</em></span> users by assigning access <span class="emphasis"><em>privileges</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>roles</em></span>,
and assigning those roles to users. For example, this
<a class="link" href="authorization.html" title="User authorization">role-based access control</a> mechanism (a.k.a RBAC) enables
you to specify that the user <code class="literal">kandorra</code> can only perform read operations on the
<code class="literal">events</code> index and can’t do anything at all with other indices.</p><p>X-Pack security also supports <a class="link" href="ip-filtering.html" title="Restricting connections with IP filtering">IP-based authorization</a>. You can
whitelist and blacklist specific IP addresses or subnets to control network-level
access to a server.</p><h3><a id="preserving-data-integrity"></a>Preserving Data Integrity<a xmlns="" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/security/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>A critical part of security is keeping confidential data confidential.
Elasticsearch has built-in protections against accidental data loss and
corruption. However, there’s nothing to stop deliberate tampering or data
interception. X-Pack security preserves the integrity of your data by
<a class="link" href="ssl-tls.html" title="Setting Up TLS on a Cluster">encrypting communications</a> to and from nodes.
For even greater protection, you can increase the <a class="link" href="ciphers.html" title="Enabling cipher suites for stronger encryption">encryption strength</a> and
<a class="link" href="separating-node-client-traffic.html" title="Separating node-to-node and client traffic">separate client traffic from node-to-node communications</a>.</p><h3><a id="maintaining-audit-trail"></a>Maintaining an Audit Trail<a xmlns="" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/security/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p>Keeping a system secure takes vigilance. By using X-Pack security to maintain
an audit trail, you can easily see who is accessing your cluster and what they’re
doing. By analyzing access patterns and failed attempts to access your cluster,
you can gain insights into attempted attacks and data breaches. Keeping an
auditable log of the activity in your cluster can also help diagnose operational
issues.</p><h3><a id="_where_to_go_next_2"></a>Where to Go Next<a xmlns="" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/6.3/docs/en/stack/security/index.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="security-getting-started.html" title="Getting started with security">Getting Started</a>
