<p>When your integration is done, it&#8217;s time to open a PR to include it in the integrations repository.
Before opening your PR, run:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-terminal">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-terminal">elastic-package check</pre>
</div>
<p>The <code class="literal">check</code> command ensures the package is built correctly, formatted properly,
and aligned with the spec.
Passing the <code class="literal">check</code> command is required before adding your integration to the repository.</p>
<p>When CI is happy, merge your PR into the integrations repo.</p>
<p>CI will kick off a build job for the master branch, which can release your integration to the package-storage. It means that it will open a PR to the Package Storage/snapshot with the built integration if only the package version doesn&#8217;t already exist in the storage (hasn&#8217;t been released yet).</p>
<h3><a id="_promote"></a>Promote<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/main/docs/en/integrations/publish-integration.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve tested your integration with Kibana, it&#8217;s time to promote it to staging or production.
Run:</p>
<div class="pre_wrapper lang-terminal">
<pre class="programlisting prettyprint lang-terminal">elastic-package promote</pre>
</div>
<p>The tool will open 2 PRs (promote and delete) to the package-storage: target and source branches.</p>
<p>Please review both PRs on your own, check if CI is happy and merge - first target, then source. Once any PR is merged, the CI will kick off a job to bake a new Docker image of package-storage (tracking). Ideally the "delete" PR should be merged once the CI job for "promote" is done, as the Docker image of previous stage depends on the later one.</p>

<div class="admon_content">
<p>When you are ready for your changes in the integration to be released, remember to bump up the package version. It is up to you, as the package developer, to decide how many changes you want to release in a single version. For example, you could implement a change in a PR and bump up the package version in the same PR. Or you could implement several changes across multiple PRs and then bump up the package version in the last of these PRs or in a separate follow up PR.</p>
