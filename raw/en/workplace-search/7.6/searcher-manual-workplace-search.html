<p>With all these useful applications and services generating data, it&#8217;s a challenge to keep things organized. You have important files and pressing issues stashed all over the place.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>Workplace Search helps you find them, organize them, and action them.</strong></span></p>

<p>This is <em>The Searcher&#8217;s Manual</em>. In five minutes, you&#8217;ll learn about organization-wide search. And you&#8217;ll never want to look back.</p>
<p>First, login. Then <span class="strong strong"><strong>let&#8217;s go</strong></span>!</p>
<h3><a id="speaking-your-language"></a>Speaking Your Language</h3>
<p>You have met many search bars. Google has one, as does Bing, Yahoo – and most popular websites and applications. This one is like those, but with one key difference: it doesn&#8217;t search <em>one thing</em> – it searches many different things: <span class="strong strong"><strong>your</strong></span> things.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>It&#8217;s one search bar for your everyday work life. And it understands your natural language.</strong></span></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to type strange incantations. You can phrase your search as if you were speaking to another person:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
"monthly accounting report edited by <span class="strong strong"><strong>Alvin Accountant</strong></span> in <span class="strong strong"><strong>sheets</strong></span>".
</li>
<li class="listitem">
"crippling bugs assigned to <span class="strong strong"><strong>Erica Engineer</strong></span> in <span class="strong strong"><strong>GitHub</strong></span> with status <span class="strong strong"><strong>blocked</strong></span>."
</li>
<li class="listitem">
"team sync in <span class="strong strong"><strong>drive</strong></span> from <span class="strong strong"><strong>yesterday</strong></span>"
</li>
<li class="listitem">
"<span class="strong strong"><strong>pdf</strong></span> from <span class="strong strong"><strong>yesterday</strong></span> with status <span class="strong strong"><strong>to do</strong></span>"
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>When you hit on a key phrase, the text will turn blue and the parameters of your search will be toggled automatically.</strong></span></p>

<p>Try out some example searches on your own.</p>
<h3><a id="window-into-work"></a>Your Window into Work</h3>
<p>The main dashboard shows you what&#8217;s new and the content sources through which you can search. New files will appear under <span class="strong strong"><strong>Recent Activity</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Search for things using the above method. Once you have searched, you can manually supplement your queries by setting the <span class="strong strong"><strong>time</strong></span> and <span class="strong strong"><strong>relevancy</strong></span>. Unless you specify a time frame using natural language, the default is <span class="strong strong"><strong>All Time</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Click the clock to set your own custom time frame:</p>
<div id="manual-time-frame" class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/manual-time-frame.png" alt="It&#8217;s the search UI. A search for product is present, and there are some results. The time dropdown is invoked and you can select yesterday, last week, last month, or a custom frame.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 3. Enterprise Search - A mighty fine search experience</div>
</div>
<p>Click the button that says <span class="strong strong"><strong>Relevance</strong></span> to change between search modes. You can sort by Relevance or by Recently Updated:</p>
<div id="manual-relevance" class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/manual-recently-updated.png" alt="The Relevance dropdown menu next to the searchbar. The Recently Updated option is invoked and the results have shifted accordingly with the most recent at the top.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 4. Relevance or Recently Updated</div>
</div>
<p>After you search for something, you can toggle facets on and off. This means you can add or remove sources from the search, change the type, person, and more:</p>
<div id="manual-fully-faceted" class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/manual-facets.png" alt="A long list of facets. It uses GitHub as an example. Shows " width="type"" height="where pull request is selected">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 5. Fully faceted</div>
</div>
<p>Each time you add a facet, your results will reflect your choices. Narrow them down as much as you&#8217;d like. Each facet value can be included in a natural query.</p>
<p>So you could write: "<span class="strong strong"><strong>open</strong></span> <span class="strong strong"><strong>pull requests</strong></span> created by <span class="strong strong"><strong>kovyrin</strong></span> in the super-code/aerosolve <span class="strong strong"><strong>repository</strong></span>" as a query.</p>
<p>The facets would then toggle automatically. With these tricks, you&#8217;ll be able to keep narrowing things down to find just what you&#8217;re seeking.</p>
<h3><a id="adding-private-source"></a>Adding Private Sources</h3>
<p>Your administrator has added a number of sources through which you can search. <span class="strong strong"><strong>But you can also add your own</strong></span>. Each person can add their own <span class="strong strong"><strong>private sources</strong></span>. You might add your own private GitHub source, private Google Drive, or your own private <a class="xref" href="workplace-search-custom-api-sources.html" title="Custom API sources">Custom sources</a>. When you add private sources, <span class="strong strong"><strong>only you</strong></span> will be able to search through them. That way, you can supplement your organization&#8217;s information with your own things.</p>
<p>Click <span class="strong strong"><strong>My Account</strong></span> in the top right corner.</p>
<p>Select <span class="strong strong"><strong>Account Settings</strong></span>.</p>
<p>This is where you can change some of your personal information and your password. But you can also select from one of two tabs. Select the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Private Content Sources</strong></span> tab:</p>
<div id="private-content-source" class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ees-private-content-sources.png" alt="A tab with the aforementioned words.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 6. Private content sources tab</div>
</div>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice you don&#8217;t have any private sources yet – no problem. Click the green button that says: <span class="strong strong"><strong>Add a private content source</strong></span>. From there, you&#8217;ll be able to add any content source that your administrator has connected:</p>
<div id="add-private-content-source" class="imageblock screenshot">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ees-add-private-source.png" alt="A list of content sources with their brand logos which you can add. There&#8217;s an octocat, a box, all sorts of neat things.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 7. Add a private content source</div>
</div>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>These sources <em>only show up for you</em>!</strong></span></p>
<p><em>Pssst!… If building Custom API Sources is your kind of thing, we have the <a class="xref" href="workplace-search-custom-api-sources.html" title="Custom API sources">Custom sources</a> guide for that.</em></p>
<h3><a id="summary"></a>Summary</h3>
<p>That&#8217;s the basics. Workplace Search will continue to evolve. As you get more and more used to searching for things, your workflow will change over time. You&#8217;ll name files according to how you&#8217;re used to searching for them and gradually build knowledge bases that are more searchable.</p>
<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>It&#8217;s a fun road to a more organized future.</strong></span></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
