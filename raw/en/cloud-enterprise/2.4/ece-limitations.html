When you install Elastic Cloud Enterprise on a new host and assign it the allocator role from the command line with the <code class="literal">--roles "allocator"</code> parameter during installation, new deployments might not get created on the allocator. To resolve this issue, see <a class="link" href="ece-issues.html#ece-issues-allocator-usage" title="Allocators not being used">Allocators Are Not Being Used</a>.
</li><li class="listitem">
Some change management tools that auto-reload firewall rules can cause networking issues. Specifically, Docker networking can fail on new containers after restarting the <code class="literal">iptables</code> service. To avoid networking failures, disable the automatic reloading of firewall rules.
</li><li class="listitem">
On RHEL and CentOS, the firewalld service is not compatible with Docker and interferes with the installation of ECE. You must disable firewalld before installing or reinstalling ECE.
</li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
When you use OverlayFS with Kernel-LT 4.4.156 and later, there is a known
regression that prevents Elastic Cloud Enterprise from completing the installation. From the
kernel-archive, use Kernel 4.4.155.
</li><li class="listitem">
If you install ECE on AWS, you likely need to <a class="link" href="ece-issues.html#ece-aws-private-ip" title="Cloud UI, Elasticsearch, and Kibana endpoint URLs inaccessible on AWS">modify the cluster endpoint</a>, as the public hostname resolves to a different IP address externally than it does internally on the cluster.
</li><li class="listitem">
ECE is unable to support VMotion functionality in VMWare. To use ECE, you must disable VMotion.
</li><li class="listitem">
When you use virtualization resources, make sure that you avoid resource overallocation.

Changing the generated password for the <code class="literal">admin</code> user on the administration console deployment that backs the Cloud UI is not supported.

When configuring Elastic Cloud Enterprise role-based access control:

Trying to use an invalid SAML provider can cause the security deployment to bootloop. The deployment falls back to the previous configuration, but if there are any issues between the UI and the actual configuration, remove or update the SAML provider profile. If the problem persists, review the deployment activity and logs.

This version of ECE is known to have a problem with snapshot storage integrations, breaking support for Minio (when using the Elastic Stack 6.4.2 or later), Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and Microsoft Azure Storage. Except for Microsoft Azure Storage, these storage integrations are available again in ECE 2.1 and we recommend that you upgrade to this later version. A possible workaround to reenable Microsoft Azure Storage is still being investigated. After upgrading to ECE 2.1, you might also need to upgrade your deployments to the Elastic Stack 6.5.0 or later to reenable snapshot storage support.

</li><li class="listitem">
Pending plan changes for your deployment in the Cloud UI that exceed the available capacity will fail as expected, but might then require you to manually recover from the failure. (To recover, locate the details for the plan attempt and copy the diff; manually edit the diff to revert to the original plan and apply the modified plan into the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Advanced cluster configuration</strong></span> panel.)
</li><li class="listitem">
X-Pack monitoring features and Marvel can be used only to send monitoring data between Elasticsearch clusters that are running the same version.
</li><li class="listitem">
ECE has a maximum limit of 420 seconds, so we recommend optimizing long-running queries in Elasticsearch.

If upgrading from a version earlier than 2.1.0 to a version between &gt;2.1.0 and ⇐2.3.1, a known problem will fail the upgrade. If your upgrade path matches these versions, see <a class="link" href="ece-upgrade.html#ece-upgrade-version-caution" title="Important: Check if you can upgrade directly">Before upgrading check your upgrade path</a>.
