This new product lets you provision, monitor, and orchestrate a fleet of Elasticsearch clusters and Kibana instances the way you want, in the environment you choose, from the Cloud UI or the RESTful API.</p><p>New for Elastic Cloud Enterprise version 1.0.0:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
Snapshot repositories are now supported and can be managed for your entire Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation. For 1.0.0, we support AWS S3, with support for additional repositories coming in a future release. When a repository is specified for an Elasticsearch cluster, a snapshot is taken every 30 minutes or at the interval you specify. To learn more, see <a class="link" href="ece-manage-repositories.html" title="Manage Snapshot Repositories">Manage Snapshot Repositories</a>.
</li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
Several security enhancements are available:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem">
A roles token must now be specified before a new host is allowed to join an existing ECE installation. To make it easier to use roles tokens, a basic token is automatically provided after installation on the first host. For automation purposes, you can also generate new tokens to install ECE on hosts and add the right roles at the same time. Additional functionality is available for revoking tokens that are no longer needed and for emergencies. To learn more, see <a class="link" href="ece-generate-roles-token.html" title="Generate Roles Tokens">Generate Roles Tokens</a>, <a class="link" href="ece-revoke-roles-token.html" title="Revoke Roles Tokens">Revoke Roles Tokens</a>, and <a class="link" href="ece-troubleshooting-emergency.html" title="Using the Emergency Roles Token">Using the Emergency Roles Token</a>.
</li><li class="listitem">
A new <code class="literal">readonly</code> user is now automatically created. This user can access any of the resources that the <code class="literal">root</code> user can access, but it cannot modify them. The credentials of the read-only user are provided when you install ECE on your first host.
</li><li class="listitem">
The passwords for the <code class="literal">root</code> and <code class="literal">readonly</code> administration console users that you use to log into the Cloud UI can now be reset. To learn more, see <a class="link" href="ece-reset-passwords.html" title="Reset User Passwords">Reset User Passwords</a>.
</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">
You can now update your ECE installation with the latest Elasticsarch and Kibana versions from Elastic. Support for Elastic Stack packs lets you add these new versions of the Elastic Stack to your installation as they become available. Elasticsearch versions 5.4.0 and 2.4.5 are already included with ECE, along with Kibana. To learn more, see <a class="link" href="ece-manage-elastic-stack.html" title="Manage Elastic Stack Versions">Manage Elastic Stack Versions</a>.
</li><li class="listitem">
The centralized monitoring and log aggregation that allows you to monitor your entire Elastic Cloud Enterprise installation through Kibana has been improved with easier access to logs from the Cloud UI and automatic curation of logs. To learn more, see <a class="link" href="ece-monitoring-ece.html" title="Monitoring Your Installation">Monitor Elastic Cloud Enterprise</a>.
</li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
The RESTful API has been improved with additional functionality, including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem">
Support for configuring the infrastructure of Elastic Cloud Enterprise itself, such as support for generating roles tokens and uploading new Elastic Stack packs.
</li><li class="listitem">
Improved support for managing Elasticsearch and Kibana, such as stopping and starting clusters and individual instances, and putting clusters into maintenance mode.
</li></ul></div><p class="simpara">These are just some examples of what has been added to our RESTful API since the beta releases. To learn more, see <a class="link" href="ece-api-reference.html" title="API Reference">API Reference</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
The ECE installation script has been renamed to <code class="literal">elastic-cloud-enterprise.sh</code> and now supports several actions to install Elastic Cloud Enterprise or to modify your installation:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">install</code> - To install Elastic Cloud Enterprise on a host, either to start a new installation or to add a host to an existing installation.
