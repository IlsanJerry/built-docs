This version of ECE is known to have a problem with snapshot storage integrations, breaking support for Minio (when using the Elastic Stack 6.4.2 or later), Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and Microsoft Azure Storage. Except for Microsoft Azure Storage, these storage integrations are available again in ECE 2.1 and we recommend that you upgrade to this later version. A possible workaround to reenable Microsoft Azure Storage is still being investigated. After upgrading to ECE 2.1, you might also need to upgrade your deployments to the Elastic Stack 6.5.0 or later to reenable snapshot storage support.
</li><li class="listitem">
The index lifecycle management (ILM) feature that is part of the Elastic Stack 6.6 is not currently supported for Elastic Cloud Enterprise.
</li><li class="listitem">
When you install Elastic Cloud Enterprise on a new host and assign it the allocator role from the command line with the <code class="literal">--roles "allocator"</code> parameter during installation, new deployments might not get created on the allocator. To resolve this issue, see <a class="link" href="ece-issues.html#ece-issues-allocator-usage" title="Allocators not being used">Allocators Are Not Being Used</a>.
</li><li class="listitem">
On RHEL and CentOS, the firewalld service is not compatible with Docker and interferes with the installation of ECE. You must disable firewalld before installing or reinstalling ECE.
</li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
When you use OverlayFS with Kernel-LT 4.4.156 and later, there is a known
regression that prevents Elastic Cloud Enterprise from completing the installation. From the
kernel-archive, use Kernel 4.4.155.
</li><li class="listitem">
Some change management tools that auto-reload firewall rules can cause networking issues. Specifically, Docker networking can fail on new containers after restarting the <code class="literal">iptables</code> service. To avoid networking failures, disable the automatic reloading of firewall rules.
</li><li class="listitem">
Pending plan changes for your deployment in the Cloud UI that exceed the available capacity will fail as expected, but might then require you to manually recover from the failure. (To recover, locate the details for the plan attempt and copy the diff; manually edit the diff to revert to the original plan and apply the modified plan into the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Advanced cluster configuration</strong></span> panel.)
</li><li class="listitem">
X-Pack monitoring features and Marvel can be used only to send monitoring data between Elasticsearch clusters that are running the same version.
</li><li class="listitem">
ECE has a maximum limit of 420 seconds, so we recommend optimizing long-running queries in Elasticsearch.
</li><li class="listitem">
If you install ECE on AWS, you likely need to <a class="link" href="ece-issues.html#ece-aws-private-ip" title="Cloud UI, Elasticsearch, and Kibana endpoint URLs inaccessible on AWS">modify the cluster endpoint</a>, as the public hostname resolves to a different IP address externally than it does internally on the cluster.
</li><li class="listitem">
ECE is unable to support VMotion functionality in VMWare. To use ECE, you must disable VMotion.
</li><li class="listitem">
When you use virtualization resources, make sure that you avoid resource overallocation.
</li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
Changing the generated password for the <code class="literal">admin</code> user on the administration console deployment that backs the Cloud UI is not supported. This is the <code class="literal">admin</code> user on the <code class="literal">admin-console-elasticsearch</code> deployment that gets created during the ECE installation.
</p><div class="warning admon"><div class="icon"><img alt="Warning" src="images/icons/warning.png" /></div><div class="admon_content"><p>Do not change the generated password for the <code class="literal">admin</code> user on the administration console deployment or you risk losing administrative access to your installation.</p></div></div></li></ul></div><p>Some additional limitations apply when securing your installation.
