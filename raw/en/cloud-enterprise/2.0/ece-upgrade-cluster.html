The difference is that a minor upgrade takes you from 2.2 to 2.3, for example, and requires no downtime as a rolling upgrade is performed. A major upgrade takes you from from 2.3 to 5.0, for example, and requires a full cluster restart as part of the upgrade process.</p><p>Major version upgrades sometimes require other changes due to breaking changes or discontinued features. For example, some special considerations apply when <a class="link" href="ece-upgrading-v5.html" title="Upgrade to Elasticsearch 5.x">upgrading to Elasticsearch 5.0</a>. Our recommended approach for major version upgrades is to create a new deployment with the latest major version you want to upgrade to, reindex everything and make sure index requests are temporarily sent to both clusters. With the new cluster ready, tested, and working, you can then remove the old deployment.</p><h3><a id="ece-before_you_begin_13"></a>Before You Begin</h3><p>When upgrading from one recent major Elasticsearch version to the next, we recommend that you prepare ahead of time to make the process go smoothly.
