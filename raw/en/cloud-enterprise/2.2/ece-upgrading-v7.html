Preparing for your upgrade ahead of time ensures that you can enjoy the new features and improved usability of Elasticsearch 7.x as quickly as possible.</p><h3><a id="ece-before_you_begin_18"></a>Before you begin</h3><p>Elastic Cloud Enterprise upgrades differ from your on-premise installation because all major configuration changes for Elasticsearch, Kibana, and the security features are handled for you.</p><p>When you upgrade, Elastic Cloud Enterprise automatically runs the deprecation API to retrieve information about the cluster, node, and index-level settings that need to be removed or changed. If there are any deprecation issues that would prevent the upgraded deployment from successfully performing, the upgrade fails. To resolve the deprecation issues, use the Upgrade Assistant in Kibana. If your cluster does not include a Kibana instance yet, you can
<a class="link" href="ece-manage-kibana.html" title="Manage your Kibana instance">enable Kibana first</a>
then use the Upgrade Assistant. After you resolve the deprecation issues, try the upgrade again.</p><p>For more information, refer to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">

After a major version upgrade is complete, and the first successful snapshot with the new major version is available, all snapshots taken with the previous version of Elasticsearch are removed.</p><p>For example, before upgrading from Elasticsearch version 6.7 to version 7.x, a snapshot is taken. After the upgrade to version 7.x is complete, and a snapshot is available, all snapshots taken with version 6.x are removed.</p><div xmlns="" class="tip admon"><div class="icon"><img alt="Tip" src="images/icons/tip.png" /></div><div class="admon_content"><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To enable snapshots, configure the snapshot repository.</p></div></div><h4><a id="ece-upgrading-v7-reindex"></a>Reindex indices</h4><p>Elasticsearch 7.x is compatible with indices created in version 6.0 or later.

A breaking change is the result of a functional change between major Elasticsearch versions, and requires you to perform additional steps to ensure that you can use the new version as intended.</p><p>For more information, refer to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/breaking-changes.html" target="_top">Breaking changes in 7.0</a>.</p><h4><a id="ece-upgrading-v7-issues"></a>Review the known issues</h4><p>The following known issues apply to the Elastic Stack 7.0.0 release:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
There are deprecated APIs in 7.0.0 that are still available for use. If you see warnings in the logs about the deprecated APIs, you can ignore them.
