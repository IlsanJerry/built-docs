As this data ages, practicing good index management ensures that your data is being stored in the most cost-effective way possible. In practical terms this means that, if you customize a deployment that includes more than one data configuration, you must also specify how Elastic Cloud Enterprise should manage your indices.</p><p>In a hot-warm architecture, configuring index management typically means specifying where new indices get created initially and then where they get moved to later on. Additional features are available if you configure index lifecycle management (ILM), including the automatic roll-over of index aliases to new indices when existing indices are getting too large or too old, and deleting indices when they are no longer useful to you.</p><h4><a id="ece-before_you_begin_13"></a>Before you begin</h4><p>Configuring index management is part of the larger task of <a class="link" href="ece-create-deployment.html" title="Create your deployment">creating deployments</a> and customizing them. Which index management methods are available to you depends on which version of the Elastic Stack you are using. Index lifecycle management (ILM) requires that you use version 6.7 or later and is the new default index management method. For versions before 6.7, index curations is the only available method to manage your indices.</p><p>For custom deployment templates, only those index management methods are available that your system administrator configured when <a class="link" href="ece-configuring-ece-create-templates.html" title="Create deployment templates">creating the template</a>.</p><p>For existing deployments with a hot-warm architecture that are configured to use index curation: You cannot change from one index management method to another using the instructions in this section, but you can <a class="link" href="ece-migrate-index-management.html" title="Migrate to index lifecycle management">migrate to index lifecycle management</a> with some additional steps.</p><h4><a id="ece-steps_5"></a>Steps</h4><p>To configure index management when you customize a new deployment:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">

<span class="strong strong"><strong>Hot.</strong></span> The index is actively being queried and written to. You can
roll over to a new index when the original index reaches a specified size, document count, or age.  When a rollover occurs, a new index is created, added to the index alias, and designated as the new hot index. You can still query the previous indices, but you only ever write to the hot index. See <a class="ulink" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.0/creating-index-lifecycle-policies.html#setting-a-rollover-action" target="_top">Setting a rollover action</a>.
</li><li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Warm.</strong></span> The index is typically searched at a lower rate than when the data is hot. The index is not used for storing new data, but might occasionally add late-arriving data, for example, from a Beat with a network problem that’s now fixed. You can optionally shrink the number replicas and move the shards to a different set of nodes with smaller or less performant hardware. You can also reduce the number of primary shards and force merge the index into smaller <a class="ulink" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0//indices-segments.html" target="_top">segments</a>.
</li><li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Cold.</strong></span> The index is no longer being updated and is seldom queried, but is still searchable. If you have a big deployment, you can move it to even less performant hardware. You might also reduce the number of replicas because you expect the data to be queried less frequently. To keep the index searchable for a longer period, and reduce the hardware requirements, you can use the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0//frozen-indices.html" target="_top">freeze action</a>. Queries are slower on a frozen index because the index is reloaded from the disk to RAM on demand.
</li><li class="listitem">
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Delete.</strong></span> The index is no longer relevant. You can define when it is safe to delete it.
</li></ul></div><p class="simpara">The index lifecycle always includes an active hot phase. The warm, cold, and delete phases are optional. For example, you might define all four phases for one policy and only a hot and delete phase for another. See <a class="ulink" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0//_actions.html" target="_top">Actions</a> for more information on the actions available in each phase.</p><p class="simpara">There are additional benefits to ILM, such as integration with cross-cluster search, which lets you to auto-unfollow read-only indices. You can also set the recovery priority action, so that newer indices recover faster than older ones.

Index curation
</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
Creates new indices on hot nodes first and moves them to warm nodes later on, based on the index patterns you specify. Also manages replica counts for you, so that all shards of an index can fit on the right data nodes. Compared to index lifecycle management, index curation for time-based indices supports only one action, to move indices from nodes on one data configuration to another, but it is more straightforward to set up initially and all setup can be done directly from
the Cloud UI.
</p><p class="simpara">If you need to delete indices once they are no longer useful, you can run <a class="ulink" href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/5.6/index.html" target="_top">Curator</a> or your own automation script on-premise to manage indices for Elasticsearch clusters hosted on Elastic Cloud Enterprise.</p><p class="simpara">To configure index curation:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="a"><li class="listitem">
