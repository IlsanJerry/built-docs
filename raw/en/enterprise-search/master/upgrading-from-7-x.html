<p>In previous versions it was possible to run Enterprise Search without enabling
the Elastic Stack security features. This mode is no longer supported in 8.0.
You must <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/configuring-stack-security.html" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">configure security for the Elastic Stack</a>
before using Enterprise Search.</p>

<p>Enterprise Search 8.0 removes Workplace Search admin access tokens and adds <a href="/guide/en/workplace-search/master/workplace-search-api-authentication.html#auth-token" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workplace Search API keys</a>.</p>
<p>When upgrading to Enterprise Search 8.0, existing admin access tokens are migrated to API keys.
(Specifically, tokens with write access that are associated with an admin user are migrated.)
Therefore, migrated admin access tokens will continue to work as API keys.</p>
<p>However, the behavior of API keys differs from admin access tokens.
Each admin access token was associated with a specific user.
When requesting documents using an admin access token, <a href="/guide/en/workplace-search/master/workplace-search-sources-document-permissions.html" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document-level permissions</a> were applied, limiting the response to only the documents the user could access.
When requesting documents using a Workplace Search API key, document-level permissions are <em>not</em> applied.
Requests using a Workplace Search API key can access all documents for a content source.</p>
<p>Also, Workplace Search API keys can be used with <a href="/guide/en/workplace-search/master/workplace-search-content-sources.html#organizational-vs-private" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organization content sources</a> only.
They cannot be used with private content sources.</p>
<p>Workplace Search API keys are useful for integrators who are building their own connectors using custom sources.
For example, an integrator can use a Workplace Search API key to list all documents for a content source to determine which documents to delete.</p>
<p>Workplace Search admin users can list, create, and delete Workplace Search API keys within Kibana.
See <a href="/guide/en/workplace-search/master/workplace-search-api-authentication.html#auth-token" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workplace Search API keys</a>.</p>
