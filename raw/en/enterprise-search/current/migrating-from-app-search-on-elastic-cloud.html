<p>From 7.7.0 onwards, App Search is distributed as Elastic Enterprise Search, a solution which
combines Elastic App Search and Elastic Workplace Search into a single package
(<a href="/blog/elastic-enterprise-search-now-available-on-elastic-cloud" class="ulink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the Elastic Cloud announcement</a>).
That transition means there is no direct upgrade path from App Search 7.6 to 7.7.
Rather, App Search 7.6 users must migrate to Enterprise Search.
The following document outlines the migration process.</p>
<p>As of 7.9.1, there are a few known issues with the migration process, outlined below. Although it is generally safe to migrate now, you may wish to wait until the following issues are resolved.</p>

<p>Always make sure you have the latest backups for your original App Search deployment and do not
switch production traffic to Enterprise Search until you have fully vetted its functionality.</p>

<h4><a id="migrating-from-elastic-cloud-app-search-migration-process-overview"></a>Migration process overview</h4>
<p>There is an assistant to help you migrate your App Search deployment to Enterprise Search, available when you click on "Upgrade" in your Deployments page. A step-by-step guide to migrating is available:</p>

<p>The Elastic Cloud upgrade path provides a few deployment template options. Choosing
anything other than "Elastic Enterprise Search" may under-provision your deployment, which may lead
to downtime or other severe issues.</p>

<p>Currently, if you create an Enterprise Search deployment from an App Search snapshot or attempt a
migration using the provided Elastic Cloud upgrade process, the new deployment may fail to start
Enterprise Search instances.</p>
<p>It is a known issue related to the snapshot recovery process on very large deployments and it will
be addressed in the next Enterprise Search release. If you&#8217;ve experienced this, you have two options:</p>
<div class="olist orderedlist">
<ol class="orderedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Re-apply the deployment plan on your new Enterprise Search cluster by clicking "Edit" within
Elastic Cloud view of your deployment and then "Save" without making any changes. This will retry
the Enterprise Search instance provisioning process and should get your deployment into a healthy
state.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Revert to your existing App Search deployment and contact support to assist you with the migration process.

</ol>
