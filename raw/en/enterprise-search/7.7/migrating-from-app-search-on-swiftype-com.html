<p><span class="strong strong"><strong>App Search is now available on Elastic Cloud.</strong></span> You can migrate from Swiftype.com to Elastic Cloud on an engine-by-engine basis. <a href="/blog/elastic-app-search-now-available-on-elasticsearch-service" class="ulink" target="_top">Learn more about App Search on Elastic Cloud&#8217;s Elasticsearch Service.</a></p>
<h4><a id="migrating-from-app-search-on-swiftype-com-sizing-storage-for-app-search-on-elastic-cloud"></a>Sizing storage for App Search on Elastic Cloud</h4>
<p>When provisioning App Search for Elastic Cloud, you&#8217;ll need App Search and Elasticsearch nodes.</p>
<p>App Search uses an Elasticsearch cluster to store everything, including your documents, logs, and analytics. You&#8217;ll spin up a number of Elasticsearch nodes along with your App Search instances on Elastic Cloud.</p>
<p>To determine how much storage you&#8217;ll need, you can start with a general rule of thumb: multiply the <span class="strong strong"><strong>number of documents across all engines</strong></span> by 250kb.</p>
<p>Migrations with less than 100,000 documents should be handled well by the default deployment in Elastic Cloud. If you&#8217;re dealing with more than 100,000 documents, you may want to consider increasing your storage. Additionally, if you have analytics or log retention requirements, you&#8217;ll need to account for those when provisioning storage.</p>
<h4><a id="migrating-from-app-search-on-swiftype-com-important-differences"></a>Important differences between App Search on Swiftype.com and App Search on Elastic Cloud</h4>
<p>Provisioning an App Search deployment on Elastic Cloud requires manual resource management. Notably:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
analytics and logging indexes must be managed manually or with some automation you will need to manage yourself (old analytics and logs indexes need to be removed according to your desired retention policy)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
storage should be monitored closely during initial document ingestion
</li>
<li class="listitem">
CPU usage should be monitored closely once the new Engine is receiving production traffic

</ul>
