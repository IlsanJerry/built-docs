<p>The waterfall chart provides a visualization of every request the page made when
a user executed it. Each line in the chart represents an HTTP network request and
helps you quickly identify what resources are taking the longest to load and in what
order they are loading.</p>
<p>The colored bars within each line indicate the time spent per resource. Each color
represents a different part of that resource&#8217;s loading process and
includes the time spent downloading content for specific Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) types: HTML, JS, CSS, Media, Font, and Other.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand each phase of a request so you can improve your site&#8217;s
speed by reducing the time spent in each one.</p>

<p>User journeys that are tested with synthetic monitoring need to consistently work for your users.
Alerting ensures any degraded performance or broken actions are fixed prior to impacts on your
bottom line or customers' experience.</p>
