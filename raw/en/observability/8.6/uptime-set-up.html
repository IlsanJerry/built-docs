<p>To set up a lightweight monitor, you need to configure the monitor, run it, and send data back to Elasticsearch.
After setup is complete, the data will be available in the Uptime app in Kibana to view, analyze, and alert on.</p>

<p>There are three ways to set up a lightweight monitor: <span class="strong strong"><strong>Heartbeat</strong></span>,  <span class="strong strong"><strong>Uptime app</strong></span>, or <span class="strong strong"><strong>project monitors</strong></span>.</p>

<td align="left" valign="top"><p>Heartbeat is a lightweight daemon that you install on a remote server to periodically
check the status of your services and determine if they are available. Performance data is
then gathered and reported back to Heartbeat, where it&#8217;s formatted and sent to the Elastic Stack.</p>
<p>This approach is only recommended for <a class="xref" href="monitor-uptime-synthetics.html#monitoring-uptime" title="Lightweight HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP monitors">lightweight checks</a>, and
works well for system administrators wanting to configure lightweight
monitors using YAML files. You should <em>not</em> use this approach to create browser monitors.
Instead, refer to <a class="xref" href="synthetic-run-tests.html" title="Create a browser monitor">Create a browser monitor</a>.</p>

</span>
</span> The Uptime app is an application in Kibana.
You can now create monitors directly in the Uptime app.
To try out this beta functionality, you will need to enable Monitor Management.</p>
<p>This approach works well if you want to configure and update monitors using a
UI in your browser or using a GitOps workflow.</p>

</span>
</span> With project monitors, you write tests in an external version-controlled project using YAML for lightweight monitors and JavaScript for browser monitors. Then, you use the <code class="literal">@elastic/synthetics</code> NPM library’s <code class="literal">push</code> command to create monitors in Kibana.</p>
<p>This approach works well if you want to create both browser monitors and
lightweight monitors. It also allows you to configure and update monitors
using a GitOps workflow.</p>

<p>To use the Elastic Synthetics integration, see the <a href="/guide/en/observability/8.3/uptime-set-up.html#uptime-set-up-choose-agent" class="ulink" target="_top">8.3 documentation</a>. The Elastic Synthetics integration is similar to the Uptime app approach described above, but contains fewer configuration options and does not allow you to run monitors against Elastic&#8217;s global managed testing locations.</p>
