<p>This is an experimental release and there is no migration path for future
releases, so <span class="strong strong"><strong>YOU MUST TEST IN A DEDICATED CLUSTER.</strong></span> In a future release, we
plan to add support for a new way of managing rolling indices that will make the
experience easier for users. However, any data stored in this release will not
be migrated in our next release, and you must wipe any data and settings changed
in Kibana and Elasticsearch to avoid future conflicts. We recommend using a dedicated test
cluster or deployment that can be deleted when you are done.</p>
<p>Ingest Manager is currently only available to users with the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/built-in-roles.html" class="ulink" target="_top">superuser role</a>. This role is necessary to create
indices, install integration assets, and update Elastic Agent configurations. In order
to use Fleet, the Elastic Agents must have a direct network connection to Kibana and
Elasticsearch. It is also possible to run the Elastic Agents in standalone mode in cases where
a network connection is not available or not needed.</p>
<p>This feature has several additional limitations at the current time:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Support for only 9 integrations (more coming soon)
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Support for only Filebeat and Metricbeat
</li>
<li class="listitem">
We recommend you enroll no more than 100 Agents
</li>
<li class="listitem">
No output to Logstash, Kafka, or other remote clusters
</li>
<li class="listitem">
No proxy support in Elastic Agent
</li>
<li class="listitem">

</li>
<li class="listitem">

</li>
<li class="listitem">

</li>
<li class="listitem">

</li>
</ul>

report issues in our <a href="https://ela.st/agent-discuss" class="ulink" target="_top">discuss forum</a>.</p>
