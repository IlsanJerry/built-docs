<h3><a id="fleet-security-account"></a>Service account<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/fleet-developer/fleet-security-model.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Fleet Server utilises a service token to communicate with Elasticsearch, which contains a <code class="literal">fleet-server</code> service account. Each Fleet Server can use its own service token, and you can share it across multiple servers. The advantage of using a separate token for each server is that you can invalidate each one separately.</p>
<p>You can create a service token by either using the Fleet UI or the Elasticsearch API:</p>
<p><code class="literal">POST _security/service/elastic/fleet-server/credential/token/&lt;my-fleet-server-token&gt;</code></p>
<p>The above creates a Fleet Server service token named <code class="literal">my-fleet-server-token</code>. After it&#8217;s created, the token is returned by the API and must be copied. It is not possible to retrieve it afterwards again.</p>
<h3><a id="fleet-api-keys"></a>API keys<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/fleet-developer/fleet-security-model.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned, the Fleet Server connects to Elasticsearch using service tokens. Elasticsearch API keys are used for the connection between Elastic Agent and the Fleet Server. Each Elastic Agent receives two API keys:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The output API key is used to send data to Elasticsearch
</li>
<li class="listitem">
The communication API key is used to communicate with the Fleet Server
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The communication API key does not have any permissions apart from communicating with the Fleet Server. The API key is validated by the Fleet Server against Elasticsearch. If the API key is invalid, Fleet Server stops communicating with the Elastic Agent.</p>
<p>The output API key is used to ingest data into Elasticsearch. This API key will have the minimal permissions needed to ingest all the data that the policy could collect. If the API Key is invalid, the Elastic Agent stops ingesting data into Elasticsearch.</p>
<div class="important admon">
<div class="icon"></div>
<div class="admon_content">
<p>Currently the API key has permissions to ingest data into all <code class="literal">logs-*</code> and <code class="literal">metrics-*</code> indices, but this will change soon.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><a id="fleet-enroll-token"></a>Enrollment token<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/master/docs/en/fleet-developer/fleet-security-model.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>The enrollment token is an Elasticsearch API key that can be retrieved multiple times by Fleet. The enrollment token is used for the initial communication between Elastic Agent and Fleet Server and can be used as many times as required. If invalidated, you can not use it anymore.</p>
<p>After the initial connection request from the Elastic Agent to the Fleet Server using the enrollment token, Fleet Server passes two API keys to the Elastic Agent (see above).</p>
