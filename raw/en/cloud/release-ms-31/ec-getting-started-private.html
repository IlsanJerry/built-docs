We provision a <span class="emphasis"><em>virtual private cloud</em></span> (VPC) for you, that we manage for you, with an exclusive set of hosts. You can connect your VPC to the environment, ensuring that the traffic stays within the same cloud provider and isn’t exposed to the public internet. All of the deployments in the environment are available to you with consolidated billing, but you can still isolate teams or users and meter their usage separately.</p><p>Elasticsearch Service Private entitles you to Platinum level support and features.</p><div class="tip admon"><div class="icon"></div><div class="admon_content"><p>Looking for public Elasticsearch Service?
