whitespace or (some) punctuation.<a id="id-1.6.4.2.1" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.6.4.2.2" class="indexterm"></a> Even in English, though, there can be
controversy: is <span class="emphasis"><em>you’re</em></span> one word or two? What about <span class="emphasis"><em>o’clock</em></span>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>cooperate</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>half-baked</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>eyewitness</em></span>?</p><p>Languages like German or Dutch combine individual words to create longer
compound words like <span class="emphasis"><em>Weißkopfseeadler</em></span> (white-headed sea eagle), but in order
to be able to return <code class="literal">Weißkopfseeadler</code> as a result for the query <code class="literal">Adler</code>
(eagle), we need to understand how to break up compound words into their
constituent parts.</p><p>Asian languages are even more complex: some have no whitespace between words,
sentences, or even paragraphs.<a id="id-1.6.4.4.1" class="indexterm"></a> Some words can be represented by a single
character, but the same single character, when placed next to other
characters, can form just one part of a longer word with a quite different
meaning.</p><p>It should be obvious that there is no silver-bullet analyzer that will
miraculously deal with all human languages. Elasticsearch ships with dedicated
analyzers for many languages, and more language-specific analyzers are
available as plug-ins.</p><p>However, not all languages have dedicated analyzers, and sometimes you won’t
even be sure which language(s) you are dealing with.  For these situations, we
need good standard tools that do a reasonable job regardless of language.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><span class="prev"><a href="mixed-lang-fields.html">
