<a id="id-1.7.2.1.2" class="indexterm"></a><a id="id-1.7.2.1.3" class="indexterm"></a>  With search,
we have a query and we want to find a subset of documents that
match the query.  We are looking for the proverbial needle(s) in the
haystack.</p><p>With aggregations, we zoom out to get an overview of our data.  Instead of
looking for individual documents, we want to analyze and summarize our complete
set of data:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
How many needles are in the haystack?
</li><li class="listitem">
What is the average length of the needles?
</li><li class="listitem">
What is the median length of the needles, broken down by manufacturer?
</li><li class="listitem">
How many needles were added to the haystack each month?
</li></ul></div><p>Aggregations can answer more subtle questions too:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
What are your most popular needle manufacturers?
</li><li class="listitem">
Are there any unusual or anomalous clumps of needles?
</li></ul></div><p>Aggregations allow us to ask sophisticated questions of our data.  And yet, while
the functionality is completely different from search, it leverages the
same data-structures.  This means aggregations execute quickly and are
<span class="emphasis"><em>near real-time</em></span>, just like search.</p><p>This is extremely powerful for reporting and dashboards.  Instead of performing
<span class="emphasis"><em>rollups</em></span> of your data (<span class="emphasis"><em>that crusty Hadoop job that takes a week to run</em></span>),
you can visualize your data in real time, allowing you to respond immediately.
Your report changes as your data changes, rather than being pre-calculated, out of
date and irrelevant.</p><p>Finally, aggregations operate alongside search requests.<a id="id-1.7.2.9.1" class="indexterm"></a>
<a id="id-1.7.2.9.2" class="indexterm"></a> This means you can
both search/filter documents <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> perform analytics at the same time, on the
same data, in a single request.  And because aggregations are calculated in the
context of a user’s search, you’re not just displaying a count of four-star hotels—you’re displaying a count of four-star hotels that <span class="emphasis"><em>match their search criteria</em></span>.</p><p>Aggregations are so powerful that many companies have built large Elasticsearch
clusters solely for analytics.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><span class="prev"><a href="phonetic-matching.html">
