<a id="id-1.6.7.2.2" class="indexterm"></a>  disk space and memory were
limited to a tiny fraction of what we are accustomed to today. It was
essential to make your index as small as possible.  Every kilobyte saved meant
a significant improvement in performance. Stemming (see <a class="xref" href="stemming.html" title="Reducing Words to Their Root Form"><em>Reducing Words to Their Root Form</em></a>) was
important, not just for making searches broader and increasing retrieval in
the same way that we use it today, but also as a tool for compressing index
size.</p><p>Another way to reduce index size is simply to <span class="emphasis"><em>index fewer words</em></span>.  For search
purposes, some words are more important than others. A significant reduction
in index size can be achieved by indexing only the more important terms.</p><p>So which terms can be left out? <a id="id-1.6.7.4.1" class="indexterm"></a>
<a id="id-1.6.7.4.2" class="indexterm"></a> We can divide terms roughly into two groups:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Low-frequency terms</span></dt><dd>Words that appear in relatively few documents in the collection.  Because of their
rarity,<a id="id-1.6.7.5.1.2.1.1" class="indexterm"></a>
<a id="id-1.6.7.5.1.2.1.2" class="indexterm"></a> they have a high value, or <span class="emphasis"><em>weight</em></span>.</dd><dt><span class="term">High-frequency terms</span></dt><dd>Common words that appear in many documents in the index, such as <code class="literal">the</code>, <code class="literal">and</code>, and
<code class="literal">is</code>. These words  have a low weight and contribute little to the relevance
score.</dd></dl></div><div class="tip admon"><div class="icon"><img alt="Tip" src="images/icons/tip.png" /></div><div class="admon_content"><p>Of course, frequency is really a scale rather than just two points labeled
<span class="emphasis"><em>low</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>high</em></span>. We just draw a line at some arbitrary point and say that any
terms below that line are low frequency and above the line are high frequency.</p></div></div><p>Which terms are low or high frequency depend on the documents themselves.  The
word <code class="literal">and</code> may be a low-frequency term if all the documents are in Chinese.
In a collection of documents about databases, the word <code class="literal">database</code> may be a
high-frequency term with little value as a search term for that particular
collection.</p><p>That said, for any language there are words that occur very
commonly and that seldom add value to a search.<a id="id-1.6.7.8.1" class="indexterm"></a>
<a id="id-1.6.7.8.2" class="indexterm"></a>  The default English
stopwords used in Elasticsearch are as follows:</p><pre class="literallayout">a, an, and, are, as, at, be, but, by, for, if, in, into, is, it,
no, not, of, on, or, such, that, the, their, then, there, these,
they, this, to, was, will, with</pre><p>These <span class="emphasis"><em>stopwords</em></span> can usually be filtered out before indexing with little
negative impact on retrieval. But is it a good idea to do so?</p></div><div class="navfooter"><span class="prev"><a href="stemming-in-situ.html">
