<h3><a id="_fixed_index_corruption_on_shrunk_indices"></a>Fixed index corruption on shrunk indices<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.7/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-7.7.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Applying deletes or updates on an index after it had been shrunk would likely
corrupt the index. We advise users of Elasticsearch 6.x who opt in for soft
deletes on some of their indices and all users of Elasticsearch 7.x to upgrade
to 7.7 as soon as possible to no longer be subject to this corruption bug. In
case upgrading in the near future is not an option, we recommend to completely
stop using <code class="literal">_shrink</code> on read-write indices and to do a force-merge right after
shrinking on read-only indices, which significantly reduces the likeliness of
being affected by this bug in case deletes or updates get applied by mistake.
This bug is fixed as of Elasticsearch 7.7.0. Low-level details can be found on the
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-9300" class="ulink" target="_top">corresponding issue</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_significant_reduction_of_heap_usage_of_segments"></a>Significant reduction of heap usage of segments<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.7/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-7.7.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>This release of Elasticsearch significantly reduces the amount of heap memory
that is needed to keep Lucene segments open. In addition to helping with cluster
stability, this helps reduce costs by storing much more data per node before
hitting memory limits.</p>

<p>We introduced transforms in 7.2.0 as a beta feature. It is now mature enough
to declare the feature GA (general availability). Transforms enable you to
pivot and summarize your data and store it in a new index. See
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7/transforms.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Transforms</a> and
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.7//transform-apis.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Transform APIs</a>.</p>
