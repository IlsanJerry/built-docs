want to manage your indices over time. Rather than simply performing management
actions on your indices on a set schedule, you can base actions on other factors
such as shard size and performance requirements.</p><p>You control how indices are handled as they age by attaching a
lifecycle policy to the index template used to create them. You can update
the policy to modify the lifecycle of both new and existing indices.</p><p>For time series indices, there are four stages in the index lifecycle:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Hot—​the index is actively being updated and queried.</li><li class="listitem">Warm—​the index is no longer being updated, but is still being queried.</li><li class="listitem">Cold—​the index is no longer being updated and is seldom queried. The
information still needs to be searchable, but it’s okay if those queries are
slower.</li><li class="listitem">Delete—​the index is no longer needed and can safely be deleted.</li></ul></div><p>The lifecycle policy governs how the index transitions through these stages and
the actions that are performed on the index at each stage. The policy can
specify:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">The maximum size or age at which you want to roll over to a new index.</li><li class="listitem">The point at which the index is no longer being updated and the number of
primary shards can be reduced.</li><li class="listitem">When to force a merge to permanently delete documents marked for deletion.</li><li class="listitem">The point at which the index can be moved to less performant hardware.</li><li class="listitem">The point at which the availability is not as critical and the number of
replicas can be reduced.</li><li class="listitem">When the index can be safely deleted.</li></ul></div><p>For example, if you are indexing metrics data from a fleet of ATMs into
Elasticsearch, you might define a policy that says:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">When the index reaches 50GB, roll over to a new index.</li><li class="listitem">Move the old index into the warm stage, mark it read only, and shrink it down
to a single shard.</li><li class="listitem">After 7 days, move the index into the cold stage and move it to less expensive
hardware.</li><li class="listitem">Delete the index once the required 30 day retention period is reached.</li></ol></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><span class="prev"><a href="urldecode-processor.html">
