<h3><a id="reading_indices_from_older_elasticsearch_versions"></a>Reading indices from older Elasticsearch versions<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Elasticsearch has full query and write support for indices created in the previous major
version. If you have indices created in Elasticsearch versions 5 or 6, you can now use
the archive functionality to import and query these indices as well.
The archive functionality provides slower read-only access to older data,
for compliance or regulatory reasons, the occasional lookback or investigation,
or to rehydrate parts of it. Access to the data is expected to be infrequent,
and can therefore happen with limited performance and query capabilities.</p>
<h3><a id="add_support_for_dots_in_field_names_for_metrics_usecases"></a>Add support for dots in field names for metrics usecases<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Metrics data can often be made of several fields with dots in their names,
sharing common prefixes, like in the following example:</p>
<pre class="screen">{
  "metrics.time" : 10,
  "metrics.time.min" : 1,
  "metrics.time.max" : 500
}</pre>
<p>Such format causes a mapping conflict as the <code class="literal">metrics.time</code> holds a value,
but it also needs to be mapped as an object in order to hold the <code class="literal">min</code> and
<code class="literal">max</code> leaf fields.</p>
<p>A new object mapping parameter called <code class="literal">subobjects</code>, which defaults to <code class="literal">true</code>,
has been introduced to preserve dots in field names. An object with <code class="literal">subobjects</code>
set to <code class="literal">false</code> can only ever hold leaf sub-fields and no further objects. The
following example shows how it can be configured in the mappings for the
<code class="literal">metrics</code> object:</p>
<pre class="screen">{
  "mappings": {
    "properties" : {
      "metrics" : {
        "type" : "object",
        "subobjects" : false
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>With this configuration any child of <code class="literal">metrics</code> will be mapped unchanged,
without expanding dots in field names to the corresponding object structure.
That makes it possible to store the metrics document above.</p>
<h3><a id="execute_self_reference_checks_once_per_pipeline"></a>Execute self-reference checks once per pipeline<a class="edit_me edit_me_private" rel="nofollow" title="Editing on GitHub is available to Elastic" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/8.3/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Ingest pipelines have a mechanism to prevent circular references in the records
they process, so that they are serializable. Prior to this change, this check was
performed after each <code class="literal">script</code> processor execution, and was ignorable.</p>
<p>Because of this check, a script processor configured with</p>
<pre class="screen">"source": """
    def x = ctx;
    ctx.x = x;
"""</pre>
<p>&#8230;&#8203;would error with <code class="literal">"type" : "illegal_argument_exception", "reason" : "Iterable
object is self-referencing itself (ingest script)"</code>.</p>
<p>If the script processor also had</p>
<pre class="screen">"ignore_failure" true</pre>
<p>&#8230;&#8203;then the handling thread would actually crash from an unrecoverable
StackOverflowError when trying to serialize the resulting event.</p>
<p>Now, this check is performed once per pipeline, remediating the potential for
a StackOverflowError. There are some side effects also:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
The resulting error message specifies which pipeline is causing the issue.
</li>
<li class="listitem">
There is a slight speed up for pipelines with multiple scripts, and a slight
slowdown for pipelines without scripts.
</li>
</ul>
