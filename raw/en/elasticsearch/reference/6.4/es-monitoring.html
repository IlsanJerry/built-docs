The
monitoring metrics are collected from each node and stored in Elasticsearch indices.</p><p>Each Elasticsearch node is considered unique based on its persistent UUID, which is
written on first start to its <a class="link" href="path-settings.html" title="path.data and path.logs"><code class="literal">path.data</code></a> directory, which
defaults to <code class="literal">./data</code>.</p><p>All settings associated with X-Pack monitoring in Elasticsearch must be set in either the
<code class="literal">elasticsearch.yml</code> file for each node or, where possible, in the dynamic
cluster settings. For more information, see <a class="xref" href="configuring-monitoring.html" title="Configuring monitoring in Elasticsearch"><em>Configuring monitoring</em></a>.</p><p><a id="es-monitoring-overview"></a>Elasticsearch is also at the core of X-Pack monitoring across the Elastic Stack. In all cases,
X-Pack monitoring documents are just ordinary JSON documents built by monitoring each
Elastic Stack component at some collection interval, then indexing those
documents into the monitoring cluster. Each component in the stack is
responsible for monitoring itself and then forwarding those documents to Elasticsearch
for both routing and indexing (storage).</p><p>The routing and indexing processes in Elasticsearch are handled by what are called
<a class="link" href="es-monitoring-collectors.html" title="Collectors">collectors</a> and
<a class="link" href="es-monitoring-exporters.html" title="Exporters">exporters</a>. In the past, collectors and exporters
were considered to be part of a monitoring "agent", but that term is generally
not used anymore.</p><p>You can view monitoring data from Kibana, where it’s easy to spot issues at a
glance or delve into the system behavior over time in order to diagnose operational
issues. In addition to the built-in status warnings, you can also set up custom
alerts based on the data in the monitoring indices.</p><p>For an introduction to monitoring your Elastic stack, including Beats, Logstash,
and Kibana, see <a class="ulink" href="/guide/en/elastic-stack-overview/6.4/xpack-monitoring.html" target="_top">Monitoring the Elastic Stack</a>.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><span class="prev"><a href="sql-syntax-reserved.html">
