<h3><a id="_fixed_index_corruption_on_shrunk_indices"></a>Fixed index corruption on shrunk indices<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.x/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-7.7.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Applying deletes or updates on an index after it had been shrunk would likely
corrupt the index. We advise users of Elasticsearch 6.x who opt in for soft
deletes on some of their indices and all users of Elasticsearch 7.x to upgrade
to 7.7 as soon as possible to no longer be subject to this corruption bug. In
case upgrading in the near future is not an option, we recommend to completely
stop using <code class="literal">_shrink</code> on read-write indices and to do a force-merge right after
shrinking on read-only indices, which significantly reduces the likeliness of
being affected by this bug in case deletes or updates get applied by mistake.
This bug is fixed as of Elasticsearch 7.7.0. Low-level details can be found on the
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-9300" class="ulink" target="_top">corresponding issue</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_transforms_now_in_ga"></a>Transforms – now in GA!<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.x/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-7.7.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>In 7.7, we move transforms from beta to general availability.</p>
<p><a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/transforms.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Transforms</a> enable you to pivot existing Elasticsearch
indices using group-by and aggregations into a destination feature index, which
provides opportunities for new insights and analytics. For example, you can use
transforms to pivot your data into entity-centric indices that summarize the
behavior of users or sessions or other entities in your data.</p>
<p>Transforms now include support for cross-cluster search. Allowing you to
create your destination feature index on a separate cluster from the source
indices.</p>
<p>Aggregation support has been expanded within transforms to include support for
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/search-aggregations-metrics-percentile-aggregation.html" class="ulink" target="_top">multi-value (percentiles)</a>
and
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/search-aggregations-bucket-filter-aggregation.html" class="ulink" target="_top">filter aggregations</a>.
We also optimized the performance of the
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/search-aggregations-bucket-datehistogram-aggregation.html" class="ulink" target="_top">date histogram aggregations</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="_introducing_multiclass_classification"></a>Introducing multiclass classification<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.x/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-7.7.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p><a href="/guide/en/machine-learning/7.x/dfa-classification.html" class="ulink" target="_top">Classification</a> using multiple classes
is now available in data frame analytics. Classification is a supervised machine learning
technique which has been already available as a binary process in the previous
release. Multiclass classification works well with up to 30 distinct
categories.</p>
<h3><a id="_feature_importance_at_inference_time"></a>Feature importance at inference time<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.x/docs/reference/release-notes/highlights-7.7.0.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>Feature importance now can be calculated at inference time. This value provides
further insight into the results of a classification or regression job and
therefore helps interpret these results.</p>
