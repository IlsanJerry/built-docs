<p>This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no warranties. Beta features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.</p>

<p>The Elastic Stack security features provide <em>service accounts</em> specifically for
integration with external services that connect to Elasticsearch, such as Fleet server.
Service accounts have a fixed set of privileges and cannot be authenticated
until you create a service account token for them. Additionally, service
accounts are predefined in code, and are always enabled.</p>
<p>With service accounts, services (such as Fleet server) can create a
service account token, authenticate with that token, and manage their own API keys.
Multiple service account tokens can be created for the same service account.
This prevents credential sharing between multiple instances of the same external service.
That is, these instances can assume the same identity while having their own distinct
service account tokens for authentication.</p>
