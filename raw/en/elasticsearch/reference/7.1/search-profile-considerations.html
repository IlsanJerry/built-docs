The act of instrumenting
low-level method calls such as <code class="literal">collect</code>, <code class="literal">advance</code>, and <code class="literal">next_doc</code> can be fairly expensive, since these methods are called
in tight loops.  Therefore, profiling should not be enabled in production settings by default, and should not
be compared against non-profiled query times.  Profiling is just a diagnostic tool.</p><p>There are also cases where special Lucene optimizations are disabled, since they are not amenable to profiling.  This
could cause some queries to report larger relative times than their non-profiled counterparts, but in general should
not have a drastic effect compared to other components in the profiled query.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="profile-limitations"></a>Limitations<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/edit/7.1/docs/reference/search/profile.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Profiling currently does not measure the search fetch phase nor the network overhead</li><li class="listitem">Profiling also does not account for time spent in the queue, merging shard responses on the coordinating node, or

The Profiler is instrumenting parts of Lucene that were
never designed to be exposed in this manner, and so all results should be viewed as a best effort to provide detailed
diagnostics.  We hope to improve this over time. If you find obviously wrong numbers, strange query structures, or
other bugs, please report them!</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><span class="prev"><a href="search-profile-aggregations.html">
