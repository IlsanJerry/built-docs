The two official .NET clients for Elasticsearch.</p><h3><a id="_why_two_clients"></a>Why two clients?<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/edit/1.x/docs/introduction.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h3><p><code class="literal">Elasticsearch.Net</code> is a very low level, dependency free, client that has no opinions about how you build and represent your requests and responses. It has abstracted
enough so that <span class="strong strong"><strong>all</strong></span> the Elasticsearch API endpoints are represented as methods but not too much to get in the way of how you want to build your json/request/response objects. It also comes with builtin, configurable/overridable, cluster failover retry mechanisms. Elasticsearch is elastic so why not your client?</p><p><code class="literal">NEST</code> is a high level client that has the advantage of having mapped all the request and response objects, comes with a strongly typed query DSL that maps 1 to 1 with the Elasticsearch query DSL, and takes advantage of specific .NET features such as covariant results. NEST internally uses, and still exposes, the low level <code class="literal">Elasticsearch.Net</code> client.</p><p>Please read the getting started guide for both <a class="link" href="elasticsearch-net-quick-start.html" title="Quick Start">Elasticsearch.Net</a> and <a class="link" href="nest-quick-start.html" title="Quick Start">NEST</a>.</p><p>include::contributing.asciidoc</p></div><div class="navfooter"><span class="prev">
