Theoretically, nodes are either dead or alive.</p><p>However, in the real world, things are never so clear.  Nodes are sometimes in a gray-zone of <span class="emphasis"><em>"probably dead but not confirmed"</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>"timed-out but unclear why"</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>"recently dead but now alive"</em></span>.</p><p>The connection pool’s job is to manage this set of unruly connections and try to provide the best behavior to the client.  There are currently two connection pool implementations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">staticConnectionPool</code>: the user provides a static list of hosts and the connection pool simply tries to use these connections as required</li><li class="listitem"><code class="literal">sniffingConnectionPool</code>: the user provides a seed list of hosts, which the client uses to sniff the rest of the cluster using the Cluster State API</li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="_php_and_connection_pooling"></a>PHP and connection pooling<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php/edit/0.4/docs/connection-pool.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h2></div></div></div><p>At first blush, the <code class="literal">sniffingConnectionPool</code> implementation seems superior.  For many languages, it is.  In PHP, the conversation is a bit more nuanced.</p><p>Because PHP is a share-nothing architecture, there is no way to maintain a connection pool across script instances.  This means that every script is responsible for creating, maintaining, and destroying connections on every instantiation.</p><p>Sniffing is a relatively lightweight operation but it may be considered a non-negligible overhead for certain PHP applications.</p><p>The average PHP script will likely load the client, execute a few queries and then close.  Imagine this script being called 1000 times per second: the sniffing connection pool will perform the sniffing and pinging process 1000 times per second.</p><p>In reality, if your script only executes a few queries, the sniffing concept is <span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> robust.  It tends to be more useful in long-lived processes which potentially "out-live" a static list.</p><p>For this reason the default connection pool is currently the <code class="literal">staticConnectionPool</code>.  You can, of course, change this default - but we strong recommend you load test and verify that it does not negatively impact your performance.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="_roundrobinselector_vs_stickyroundrobinselector"></a>RoundRobinSelector vs StickyRoundRobinSelector<a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php/edit/0.4/docs/connection-pool.asciidoc" class="edit_me" title="Edit this page on GitHub" rel="nofollow">edit</a></h2></div></div></div><p>In a similar vein as the connection pool, there is a PHP-specific selector that may be useful to some environments.</p><p>The selector’s job is to return a single connection from an array of connections.  The default is a round-robin selector that operates on a randomized list of hosts.  This ensures an even load of traffic across your cluster.  Round-robin’ing happens on a per-request basis (e.g. sequential requests go to different nodes).</p><p>Considering the nature of many PHP scripts, it is possible this is a sub-optimal strategy due to overhead of creating new connections.  For that reason, there is a slightly modified <code class="literal">StickyRoundRobinSelector</code> class.</p><p>This class prefers to use the same connection for every request, but if the node is dead (due to a previous connection failure) it will round-robin to the next node.  Using the default <code class="literal">randomizeHosts = true</code> setting, this still ensures even distribution of load across the cluster.  The load will simply be round-robin’ed on a per-script basis rather than a per-query basis.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><span class="prev"><a href="_search_operations.html">
