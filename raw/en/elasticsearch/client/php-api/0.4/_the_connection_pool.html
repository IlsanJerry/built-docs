<p>The connection pool is an object inside the client that is responsible for maintaining the current list of nodes.  Theoretically, nodes are either dead or alive.</p>
<p>However, in the real world, things are never so clear.  Nodes are sometimes in a gray-zone of <em>"probably dead but not confirmed"</em>, <em>"timed-out but unclear why"</em> or <em>"recently dead but now alive"</em>.</p>
<p>The connection pool&#8217;s job is to manage this set of unruly connections and try to provide the best behavior to the client.  There are currently two connection pool implementations:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">staticConnectionPool</code>: the user provides a static list of hosts and the connection pool simply tries to use these connections as required
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<code class="literal">sniffingConnectionPool</code>: the user provides a seed list of hosts, which the client uses to sniff the rest of the cluster using the Cluster State API
</li>
</ul>

</div></div></div>
<p>At first blush, the <code class="literal">sniffingConnectionPool</code> implementation seems superior.  For many languages, it is.  In PHP, the conversation is a bit more nuanced.</p>
<p>Because PHP is a share-nothing architecture, there is no way to maintain a connection pool across script instances.  This means that every script is responsible for creating, maintaining, and destroying connections on every instantiation.</p>
<p>Sniffing is a relatively lightweight operation but it may be considered a non-negligible overhead for certain PHP applications.</p>
<p>The average PHP script will likely load the client, execute a few queries and then close.  Imagine this script being called 1000 times per second: the sniffing connection pool will perform the sniffing and pinging process 1000 times per second.</p>
<p>In reality, if your script only executes a few queries, the sniffing concept is <em>too</em> robust.  It tends to be more useful in long-lived processes which potentially "out-live" a static list.</p>
<p>For this reason the default connection pool is currently the <code class="literal">staticConnectionPool</code>.  You can, of course, change this default - but we strong recommend you load test and verify that it does not negatively impact your performance.</p>

</div></div></div>
<p>In a similar vein as the connection pool, there is a PHP-specific selector that may be useful to some environments.</p>
<p>The selector&#8217;s job is to return a single connection from an array of connections.  The default is a round-robin selector that operates on a randomized list of hosts.  This ensures an even load of traffic across your cluster.  Round-robin&#8217;ing happens on a per-request basis (e.g. sequential requests go to different nodes).</p>
<p>Considering the nature of many PHP scripts, it is possible this is a sub-optimal strategy due to overhead of creating new connections.  For that reason, there is a slightly modified <code class="literal">StickyRoundRobinSelector</code> class.</p>
<p>This class prefers to use the same connection for every request, but if the node is dead (due to a previous connection failure) it will round-robin to the next node.  Using the default <code class="literal">randomizeHosts = true</code> setting, this still ensures even distribution of load across the cluster.  The load will simply be round-robin&#8217;ed on a per-script basis rather than a per-query basis.</p>
