<p>This list summarizes the most important enhancements in Observability 8.4.</p>
<h2><a id="_new_synthetics_app_enhancements_for_public_beta"></a>New Synthetics App enhancements for public beta<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.4/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>As we progress towards delivering an all new Synthetic Monitoring capability
within Elastic Observability, we’re excited to announce two big new enhancements
for our 8.4 stack release:</p>
<div class="ulist itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist">
<li class="listitem">
Private testing locations
</li>
<li class="listitem">
Open access to the managed testing service for all Elastic Cloud users
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>With private testing locations you can now configure a testing location on
self-managed infrastructure. This means you can test applications that
aren’t publicly available on the internet or from locations where we may not
yet have a point of presence.</p>
<p>A big part of our new Synthetics app is the ability to run synthetic monitoring
tests on our new global network of managed testing locations. With the 8.4
release, we’ll no longer be requiring users to request access. To
use our managed testing infrastructure, open the Uptime app and click
<span class="strong strong"><strong>Monitor Management</strong></span>. There is a fair usage cap in place but all test executions
are free. We’d love to get you involved and get your feedback.</p>
<h2><a id="_observability_alerting_and_rules_views_now_generally_available_ga"></a>Observability alerting and rules views now generally available (GA)<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/observability-docs/edit/8.4/docs/en/observability/whats-new.asciidoc">edit</a></h2>
<p>Alerting and rule management for Observability-specific alerts and rules have
been offered as a technical preview since 7.16. We have made significant
improvements since then and we now have robust, feature-rich
capabilities that are production ready.</p>

<p>Working alongside Cases functionality for incident management, Observability
Alerts and Rules views provide an easy way to access and manage
Observability-specific rules, alerts, and cases within the Observability UI.
With comprehensive filtering and search support, you can quickly view or edit
alerts or rules of interest.</p>
<div class="imageblock screenshot">

</div>
<p>The Rule Detail view offers rule creators and
administrators a complete history of rule executions and seamless access to
generated alerts for effective management. In 8.4 the Rule Details view has been
further enhanced to include an at-a-glance alert summary that shows the status
and timeline for triggered alerts, along with a number of other UI improvements,
including bulk action support.</p>

<p>With two new <em>Top 5</em> views introduced for version 8.4, you can quickly identify
the impact of application errors and reduce time spent identifying and tracking
errors.</p>
<p>The <span class="strong strong"><strong>Top 5 errors</strong></span> view is available from the APM Transaction details page:</p>

<p>Bringing together metric and trace data provides powerful insights to help you
understand application performance and identify the source of any issues.
Available as a beta feature in 8.4, Infrastructure metrics for containers, pods,
and hosts are available in the context of individual services. You can use the new
Infrastructure tab in the APM Service Overview to get a summary view of the
infrastructure supporting a service, with the ability to drill down into metrics
for additional details.</p>

<p>With Elastic APM already natively supporting the OpenTelemetry protocol,
instrumentation instructions have been added to Elastic APM agent onboarding to
simplify and streamline the use of OpenTelemetry agents with Elastic APM.</p>

<p>In addition, APM Server has now added support for ingestion of OpenTelemetry
summary metrics (sum and count), including those created by Prometheus exporters.</p>
