<ol class="orderedlist">

Check the Elasticsearch <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.0/logging.html#deprecation-logging" class="ulink" target="_top">deprecation log</a>

By default, deprecation warnings are logged when the log level is set to <code class="literal">WARN</code>.

<p>Logstash 6.8 and Beats 6.8 are compatible with all 7.x versions of

soon as possible to take advantage of performance improvements

<p>The Java High Level REST Client can communicate with any Elasticsearch node running
the same major version and greater or equal minor version.
When you upgrade to the next major version, the client should be
updated <span class="strong strong"><strong>after</strong></span> all of the nodes in the cluster have been updated.</p>

<h3><a id="oss-stack-upgrade"></a>Upgrading from 6.6 or earlier<a class="edit_me" rel="nofollow" title="Edit this page on GitHub" href="https://github.com/elastic/stack-docs/edit/8.0/docs/en/install-upgrade/upgrading-stack-on-prem.asciidoc">edit</a></h3>
<p>To upgrade directly to Elasticsearch 8.0.0-beta1 from versions 6.0-6.6, you must
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.0/reindex-upgrade.html" class="ulink" target="_top">manually reindex</a> any 5.x indices you need to
carry forward, and perform a <a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.0/restart-upgrade.html" class="ulink" target="_top">full cluster restart</a>.
This includes any internal indices created in 5.x, such as the <code class="literal">.kibana</code> and
<code class="literal">.security*</code> indices.</p>
<p>Make sure all 5.x indices have been deleted before upgrading to 8.0.0-beta1. Elasticsearch
8.0.0-beta1 will fail to start if any 5.x indices are present.</p>
<p>If you are running a version prior to 6.0,
<a href="/guide/en/elastic-stack/6.8/upgrading-elastic-stack.html" class="ulink" target="_top">upgrade to 6.8</a>
and reindex your old indices or bring up a new 8.0.0-beta1 cluster and
<a href="/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.0/reindex-upgrade-remote.html" class="ulink" target="_top">reindex from remote</a>.</p>
<p>The recommended path is to upgrade to 6.8 before upgrading to 8.0.0-beta1. This
makes it easier to identify the changes you need to make to upgrade and enables
you to perform a rolling upgrade with no downtime.</p>
